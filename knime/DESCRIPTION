ImmunoNodes is a collection of immunoinformatics command line tools and community KNIME nodes (http://www.knime.org), 
written in Python with FRED 2 (http://fred-2.github.io/). It offers unified interfaces to many popular immunoinformatics 
methods and covers a wide variety of standard applications, such as: (neo-)epitope, cleavage site, and TAP prediction, 
as well as HLA genotyping, and epitope-based vaccine design. Building onto of KNIME, ImmunoNodes is a powerful and 
intuitive toolbox to develop complex workflows, even without any programming experience.
